--------- OOPS Concepts ----------------------
Object Oriented Programming Structure 
1.class -----A class is a blueprint which has certian properties 
called methods and Variables 
class Vehicle{


}

2.object :- It is a real time entity. 
iphone 
1+
oppo
realme
3.interface 
4.Inheritance:- Aquiring properties of one class to another class 
class A {

10 methods 


30 variable s1000 lines 

}
class B {
10 methods 


30 variable s1000 lines 

}
A(Parent class/ Super class  )  --->B (Child Class /sub class ) 
class B extends A{


}
iphone ---Base class 
iphone1s ---Derived Class /Subclass /child class 
iphone 5s
iphone 6s
iphoneX (A)
iphone 11 (B) Intermediat version 
ipohone 12 (C) 
iphone12pro
iphone13


A ---> B,C (Independent Classes) 




1. Single Inheritance  (A->B) One class properties are accessed by other class 
2. Multiple Inheritance (A,B ---> C) ( Two or more independent classes properties are accessed by single class) 
3. Multi Level Inheritance ( A ---> B---> C)( One class Acts as a superclass and child class) 
4. Hirarchial Inheritance ( A ---> B, C) (Same class acts as a super class for two or more independent classes)
5. Hybrid Inheritance (single Inheritance+ Multilevel Inheritance ) A---> B---->C,D

100 classes ---Redundancy 
Grandparents ---> Parents ----> children ---> children 

5.polymorphism
6.Abstraction 
7.Encapsulation
